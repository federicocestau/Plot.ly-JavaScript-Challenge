# Plotly-JavaScript-Challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
The Data used is in json format. 
Programs used: Plotly, D3 and Javascript. 
Go to settings and check the website to see the Visualization of the project.
